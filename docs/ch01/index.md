### Chapter 1
# Variables & Values

**Computer systems** consist of *hardware* and *software*, both working together to carry out the steps of the **_information processing cycle_**. We can abbreviate these steps as **I** (input), **P** (processing), and **O** (output).

  * Input: retrieve data and store it in variables.

  * Processing: modify and manipulating input to produce the expected output. 

  * Output: display the results of your calculations.

This chapter tackles the simplest kind of processing: using arithmetic expressions to perform numerical calculations, and using standard library functions to perform more sophisticated mathematical processing.
